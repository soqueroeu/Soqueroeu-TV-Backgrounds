# Soqueroeu TV Backgrounds
<h3><strong><br />TV Backgrounds for Mega Bezel Shader on Retroarch<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br />WHAT IS?<br /></strong>These are backgrounds to be used with Retroarch. They look like conventional screen overlay, but will be loaded automatically along with Mega Bezel shaders.<br /><br /><strong>WHAT FOR?<br /></strong>These backgrounds were created to be used exclusively with the MegaBezel shaders authored by HyperSpaceMadness. They will not work like regular Retroarch overlay as they do not have a transparent area for tube image. <br />Without Mega Bezel Shaders they will not work as expected.<br /><br /><br /><strong>W</strong><strong>HY?<br /></strong>I wanted backgrounds that could be used with Retroarch while playing near big screens. So I was inspired by another authors works and I started working on my own backgrounds.<br /><br />These backgrounds feature simple TV images created in Photoshop. <br />They intend to use less space for the image tube, bringing more comfort for who play close to the big screens.<br /><br />I don't have great skills with graphical tools so you can find several points to improve in my work. I tried to differentiate the colors and shapes so they wouldn't be so repetitive. I hope it's useful to you.<br /><br />-------------------<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>WHAT ARE MEGA BEZEL SHADERS?</strong><br />They are shaders with great customization possibilities, besides having their glorious real time reflections lights.<br />They were developed by HyperSpaceMadness, with feedback from people who like old games.</p>
<p>By using these backgrounds and their presets, you will automatically enjoy the beautiful reflections.</p>

<p><strong>HOW TO USE THESE BACKGROUNDS?</strong><br />This guide assumes that you already use Mega Bezel shaders. If you haven't used these special shaders yet, look for additional information further down in this document for first-time instructions. These backgrouns are in 16:9 @ 3840x2160 format. Presets will always use the Standard version of Mega Bezel. Please note, there are no presets with Advanced parameter options in this package. </p>
<p>1 &ndash; Inside the downloaded .zip you will see a folder called Soqueroeu. Unzip this folder to:<br /><em>Retroarch / shaders /</em></p>
<p>2 - With a game running, load a shader preset. Find presets at:<br /><em>Retroarch/shaders/Soqueroeu/presets/TV-Consol</em>e<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>BEGINNING USERS</strong><br />If this is your first use of Mega Bezel shaders, here are the complete instructions:</p>
<p><strong>1</strong> - You must have Retroarch 1.9.1 or later (you will not be able to load in previous versions).<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>2</strong> - You need to have Slang shaders previously installed in your Retroarch. Download them from Retroarch's upgrade menu.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You will only be able to see the Slang shaders in the Retroarch download list if you have video drivers set to Vulkan. It may be necessary to save the changes and restart your Retroarch for the video driver settings to be saved.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>3</strong> - You will need to have the pack with Shader Mega Bezel. Find the links on the author's page on the Libretro forum:<br /><a href="https://forums.libretro.com/t/hsm-mega-bezel-reflection-shader-feedback-and-updates/25512/1">https://forums.libretro.com/t/hsm-mega-bezel-reflection-shader-feedback-and-updates/25512/1</a></p>
<p>If you prefer, you can follow this direct download link:<br /><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AlJgyN_LYasyoIxcS8s6B2gH947dQg?e=1M2dzs">https://1drv.ms/u/s!AlJgyN_LYasyoIxcS8s6B2gH947dQg?e=1M2dzs</a> <br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>4</strong> - If you have previous versions of Mega Bezel installed, you need to delete the old shader pack. Do not overwrite files as this can cause crashes.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>5</strong> - After downloading Mega Bezel pack, see inside the .zip there is a folder called bezel. Copy this folder into the following directory:<br /><br /><em>Retroarch/shaders/shaders_slang.</em><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>6</strong> &ndash; After downloading the TV Backgrounds pack, inside the .zip you will see a folder called Soqueroeu. Unzip this folder to:<br /><em>Retroarch/shaders/ <br /><br /></em></p>
<p><strong>7</strong>- Open Retroarch and go to the driver options (Settings&gt;Driver&gt;Video). Set the video driver to Vulcan. It also works with GLCore, but seems to be faster with Vulcan.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>8</strong> - Still in Retroach, go to <em>Settings&gt;Video&gt;Scale.<br /></em><br />Set integer value scale to OFF<br /><br />Set the screen aspect ratio to that of your monitor, for example 16: 9.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>9</strong> - With a game running, load a shader preset. Find presets at:<br /><br /><em>Retroarch/shaders/Soqueroeu/presets/TV-Console</em><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>10</strong> &ndash; If any background appears upside down, access the shader parameters and modify the option &ldquo;Flip Viewport Vertical", in the section [FLIP &amp; ROTATE].<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>11</strong> &ndash; If you want to change other shader parameters, you should know that MegaBezel offers several customization options. Once you have desired result, you can save preset to the Core (active core), content directory or whole system.<br />I recommend that you save by applying to the same platform/console folder contents, as each system operates with different display resolutions and a customization can give unwanted results from core to core.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> When saving a preset, make sure you have the Simple Presets feature set to ON. This will save a preset that has a reference to the preset you loaded, along with any parameter changes you made. This is what will keep your presets loading correctly when the shader is updated in the future.</p>
